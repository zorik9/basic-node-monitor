  # You'd typically not run `node_exporter` in a container like
  # this.
  # If so, make sure you're using `network_mode=host` to give the
  # host network namespace to the containers as well as `pid=host`. 
  # 
  # Eventually it would also make sense to extend it with other 
  # privileges and mounts. 
  #
  # I've never ran it in a container so I can't endorse doing so.
